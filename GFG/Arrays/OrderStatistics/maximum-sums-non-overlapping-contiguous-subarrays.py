K maximum sums of non-overlapping contiguous sub-arrays

Given an Array of Integers and an Integer value k, find out k
non-overlapping sub-arrays which have k maximum sums.

Examples: 

Input : arr1[] = {4, 1, 1, -1, -3, -5, 6, 2, -6, -2}, 
             k = 3.
Output : Maximum non-overlapping sub-array sum1: 8, 
         starting index: 6, ending index: 7.
         
         Maximum non-overlapping sub-array sum2: 6, 
         starting index: 0, ending index: 2.
         
         Maximum non-overlapping sub-array sum3: -1, 
         starting index: 3, ending index: 3.

Input : arr2 = {5, 1, 2, -6, 2, -1, 3, 1}, 
           k = 2.
Output : Maximum non-overlapping sub-array sum1: 8, 
         starting index: 0, ending index: 2.

         Maximum non-overlapping sub-array sum2: 5, 
         starting index: 4, ending index: 7.
Prerequisite: Kadane's algorith

Kadane's algorithm finds out only the maximum subarray sum, but using the same algorithm we
can find out k maximum non-overlapping subarray sums.

approach:
- Find out the maximum subarray in the array using Kadane's algorithm. Also find out its
starting and end indices. Print the sum of this subarray.
- Fill each cell of this subarray by -infinity.
- Repeat process 1 and 2 for k times

Time Complexity: The outer loop runs for k times and kadaneâ€™s algorithm in each iteration 
runs in linear time O(n). Hence the overall time complexity is O(k*n).
