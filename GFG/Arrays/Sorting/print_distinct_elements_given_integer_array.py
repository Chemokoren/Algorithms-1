Print All Distinct Elements of a given integer array

Given an integer array, print all distinct elements in array. The given array may 
contain duplicates and the output should print every element only once. The given array is not 
sorted.

Input: arr[] = {12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45}
Output: 12, 10, 9, 45, 2

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 1


Simple Solution - use two nested loops
The outer loop picks an element one by one starting from the leftmost element. the inner 
loop checks if element is present on the left side of it. If present, then ignores the element,
else prints the element,

We can Use Sorting to solve the problem in O(nLogn) time. The idea is simple, first sort 
the array so that all occurrences of every element becomes consecutive. Once the occurrences 
become consecutive, we can traverse the sorted array and print distinct elements in O(n) time.

We can use Hashing to solve this in O(n) time on average. The idea is to traverse the given array
from left to right and keep track of visited elements in a hash table

One more advantage of hashing over sorting is, the elements are printed in same order as they
are in the input array
