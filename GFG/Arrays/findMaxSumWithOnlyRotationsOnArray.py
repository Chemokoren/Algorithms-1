Find maximum value of Sum(i*arr[i]) with
only rotations on given array allowed

Given an array, only rotation operation is allowed 
on array. We can rotate the array as many times as we want.
Return the maximum possible summation of i*arr[i].

Input: arr[] = {1, 20, 2, 10}
Output: 72
We can get 72 by rotating array twice.
{2, 10, 1, 20}
20*3 + 1*2 + 10*1 + 2*0 = 72

Input: arr[] = {10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Output: 330
We can get 330 by rotating array 9 times.
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
0*1 + 1*2 + 2*3 ... 9*10 = 330


A Simple Solution is to find all rotations one by one, check sum of every rotation 
and return the maximum sum. Time complexity of this solution is O(n2). 

We can solve this problem in O(n) time using an Efficient Solution. 
Let Rj be value of i*arr[i] with j rotations. The idea is to calculate next 
rotation value from previous rotation, i.e., calculate Rj from Rj-1. 
We can calculate initial value of result as R0, then keep calculating next 
rotation values. 

How to efficiently calculate Rj from Rj-1? 
This can be done in O(1) time. Below are details.


Let us calculate initial value of i*arr[i] with no rotation
R0 = 0*arr[0] + 1*arr[1] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-1]

After 1 rotation arr[n-1], becomes first element of array, 
arr[0] becomes second element, arr[1] becomes third element
and so on.
R1 = 0*arr[n-1] + 1*arr[0] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-2]

R1 - R0 = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-2] - (n-1)*arr[n-1]

After 2 rotations arr[n-2], becomes first element of array, 
arr[n-1] becomes second element, arr[0] becomes third element
and so on.
R2 = 0*arr[n-2] + 1*arr[n-1] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-3]

R2 - R1 = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-3] - (n-1)*arr[n-2] + arr[n-1]

If we take a closer look at above values, we can observe 
below pattern

Rj - Rj-1 = arrSum - n * arr[n-j]

Where arrSum is sum of all array elements, i.e., 

arrSum = âˆ‘ arr[i]
        0<=i<=n-1 

1) Compute sum of all array elements. Let this sum be 'arrSum'.

2) Compute R0 by doing i*arr[i] for given array. 
   Let this value be currVal.

3) Initialize result: maxVal = currVal // maxVal is result.

// This loop computes Rj from  Rj-1 
4) Do following for j = 1 to n-1
......a) currVal = currVal + arrSum-n*arr[n-j];
......b) If (currVal > maxVal)
            maxVal = currVal   

5) Return maxVal
