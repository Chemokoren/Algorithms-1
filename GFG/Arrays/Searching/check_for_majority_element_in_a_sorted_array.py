Check for Majority Element in a sorted array

write a function to find if a given integer x appears more than n/2 times in  a sorted array of
n integers.

Basically, we need to write a function say isMajority() that takes an array (arr[] ), arrayâ€™s size (n) and a number to be searched (x) as parameters and returns true if x is a majority element (present more than n/2 times).

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 10}, x = 3
Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6}, x = 4
Output: False (x doesn't appear more than n/2 times in the given array)

Input: arr[] = {1, 1, 1, 2, 2}, x = 1
Output: True (x appears more than n/2 times in the given array)


Using Binary Search

- Use binary search methodology to find the first occurrence of the given number. 
The criteria for binary search is important here.

"""
Algorithmic Paradigm: Divide and Conquer

METHOD 3: 
it is already given that the array is sorted and there exists a majority element,
checking if a particular element is as easy as checking if the middle element of the array is 
the number we are checking against.

Since a majority element occurs more than n/2 times in an array, it will always be the middle 
element. We can use this logic to check if the given number is the majority element.
