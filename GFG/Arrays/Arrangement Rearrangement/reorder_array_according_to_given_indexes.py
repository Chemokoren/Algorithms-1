Reorder an array according to given indexes

Given two integer arrays of same size, "arr[]" and "index[]", reorder elements in "arr[]" 
according to given index array. It is not allowed to given array arr's length.

Example: 

Input:  arr[]   = [10, 11, 12];
        index[] = [1, 0, 2];
Output: arr[]   = [11, 10, 12]
        index[] = [0,  1,  2] 

Input:  arr[]   = [50, 40, 70, 60, 90]
        index[] = [3,  0,  4,  1,  2]
Output: arr[]   = [40, 60, 90, 50, 70]
        index[] = [0,  1,  2,  3,   4]

Expected time complexity O(n) and auxiliary space O(1)

A simple solution is to use an auxiliary array temp[] of same size as given arrays.
Traverse the given array and put all elements at their correct place in temp[] using index[]
Finally copy temp[] to arr[] and sell all values of index[i] as i.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
 

Another method to solve the problem is with space Complexity of O(1) is :-

Swap the elements present in the arr until the index_arr[i] is not equal to the i.

Letâ€™s dry run the below code for the given input :- 

1st iteration :- (i=0)

arr = [ 50, 40, 70, 60, 90 ]

index_arr = [3, 0, 4, 1, 2 ]

since the index_arr[i] is not equal to i

swap the content present in the arr[i] with arr[index[i] and similarly swap for the index_arr also. 
After swapping we will have the following arr and index_arr values:- 

arr = [ 60, 40, 70, 50, 90 ]

index_arr = [1, 0, 4, 3, 2 ]

Since index_arr[0] is not equal to i.

we again swap the content present at i with index_arr[i] for both the arrays (arr , index_arr).

arr = [ 40, 60, 70, 50, 90 ]

index_arr = [0, 1, 4, 3, 2 ]

2nd Iteration:- (i=1)

Since the value of index_arr[i] == i ; condition under the while loop does not get executed as the condition 
under the braces get false and hence move to the next iteration:- 

3rd Iteration :- (i=2)

Since the value of index_arr[i] is not equal to i. Swap the content.

After Swapping we will get:- 

arr = [ 40, 60, 90, 50, 70 ]

index_arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Now for the next iteration (4th and 5th iteration) since the Value of index_arr[i] is equal to i .
we just skip that loop ( because the condition under the while loop gets false and hence the while loop does
not get executed.) and move to the next iteration.
