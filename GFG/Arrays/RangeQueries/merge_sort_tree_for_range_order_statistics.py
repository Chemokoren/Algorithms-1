Merge Sort Tree for Range Order Statistics

Given an array of n numbers, the task is to answer the following queries:

kthSmallest(start, end, k): Find the kth smallest number in the range from array
                            index 'start' to 'end'


Examples:

Input : arr[] = {3, 2, 5, 1, 8, 9|
     Query 1: start = 2, end = 5, k = 2
     Query 2: start = 1, end = 6, k = 4
Output : 2
         5
Explanation:
[2, 5, 1, 8] represents the range from 2 to 
5 and 2 is the 2nd smallest number 
in the range[3, 2, 5, 1, 8, 9] represents 
the range from 1 to 6 and 5 is the 4th
smallest number in the range

The key idea is to build a Segment Tree with a vector at every node and the vector contains
all the elements of the sub-range in a sorted order. And if we observe this segment tree 
structure this is somewhat similar to the tree formed during the merge sort 
algorithm(that is why it is called merge sort tree) We use same implementation as discussed
in Merge Sort Tree (Smaller or equal elements in given row range) 

Firstly, we maintain a vector of pairs where each pair {value, index} is such that first 
element of pair represents the element of the input array and the second element of the 
pair represents the index at which it occurs. Now we sort this vector of pairs on the 
basis of the first element of each pair. After this we build a Merge Sort Tree where each 
node has a vector of indices in the sorted range. When we have to answer a query we find 
if the Kth smallest number lies in the left sub-tree or in the right sub-tree.

The idea is to use two binary searches and find the number of elements in the left sub-tree
such  that the indices lie within the given query range. Let the number of such indices be
M. If M>=K, it means we will be able to find the Kth smallest Number in the left sub-tree 
thus we call on the left sub-tree. Else the Kth smallest number lies in the right sub-tree
but this time we donâ€™t have to look for the K th smallest number as we already have first 
M smallest numbers of the range in the left sub-tree thus we should look for the remaining
part ie the (K-M)th number in the right sub-tree. 
This is the Index of Kth smallest number the value at this index is the required number. 

Thus, we can get the Kth smallest number query in range L to R, in O(n(logn)^2) by building 
the merge sort tree on indices.
