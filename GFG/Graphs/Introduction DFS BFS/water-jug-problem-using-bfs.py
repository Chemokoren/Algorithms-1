Water Jug problem using BFS

you are given a m liter jug and a n liter jug. Both the jugs are initially empty. The jugs don't
 have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. You have to use the jugs to 
 measure d liters of water where d is less than n.

(X, Y) corresponds to a state where X refers to amount of water in Jug1 and Y refers 
to amount of water in Jug 2.

Determine the path from initial state(xi, yi) to final state(xf, yf) where (xi, yi) is 
(0, 0) which indicates both jugs are initially empty and (xf, yf) indicates a state
which could be (0, d) or (d, 0).

The operations you can perform are:
1. Empty a Jug, (X,Y) ->(0,Y) Empty Jug 1
2. Fill a  Jug, (0,0) ->(X,0) Fill Jug 1
3. Pour water from one jug to the other until one of the jugs is either empty or full,
(X,Y) ->(X-d, Y+d)

Input : 4 3 2
Output : {(0, 0), (0, 3), (4, 0), (4, 3), 
          (3, 0), (1, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2),
          (0, 2)}

We run breadth first search on the states and these states will be created after 
applying allowed operations and we also use visited map of pair to keep track of states
 that should be visited only once in the search. This solution can also be achieved 
 using  depth first search.
