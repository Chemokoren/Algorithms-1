Count the number of nodes at given level in a tree using BFS

Given a tree represented as an undirected graph. Count the number of nodes at a given 
level l. It may be assumed that vertex 0 is the root of the tree.


Input :   7
          0 1
          0 2
          1 3
          1 4 
          1 5
          2 6
          2
Output :  4

Input : 6
        0 1
        0 2
        1 3
        2 4
        2 5
        2
Output : 3

BFS is a traversing algorithm that starts traversing from a selected node (source or 
starting node ) and traverses the graph layer-wise thus exploring the neighbour nodes
(ndes that are directly connected to the source node). Then, move towards the next-level
neighbor nodes.

As the name BFS suggests, traverse the graph breadth wise as follows:
1. First move horizontally and visit all the nodes of the current layer
2. Move to the next layer.

In this code, while visiting each node, the level of that node is set with an increment
in the level of its parent node, i.e. level[child] = level[parent] + 1. This is how the
level of each node is determined. The root node lies at level zero in the tree.

Given a tree with 7 nodes and 6 edges in which node 0 lies at 0 level. Level of 1 can be updated as : level[1] = level[0] +1 as 0 is the parent node of 1. Similarly, the level of other nodes can be updated by adding 1 to the level of their parent. 
level[2] = level[0] + 1, i.e level[2] = 0 + 1 = 1. 
level[3] = level[1] + 1, i.e level[3] = 1 + 1 = 2. 
level[4] = level[1] + 1, i.e level[4] = 1 + 1 = 2. 
level[5] = level[1] + 1, i.e level[5] = 1 + 1 = 2. 
level[6] = level[2] + 1, i.e level[6] = 1 + 1 = 2.
Then, count of number of nodes which are at level l(i.e, l=2) is 4 (node:- 3, 4, 5, 6)
