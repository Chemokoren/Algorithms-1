Objectives
-Define what a tree is
-Compare and contrast trees and lists
-Explain the differences between trees, binary trees, and binary search trees
-Implement operations on binary search trees

What is a tree?
- A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship

Tree Terminology

Root - top node in a tree
child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
Parent - The converse notion of a child
Siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent
Leaf - a node with no children
Edge - The connection between one node and another

Application of Trees
-HTML DOM
-Network Routing
-Abstract Syntax Tree (represent code logic -like a flowchat)
-Artificial Intelligence e.g. minimax tree
-Folders in Operating System
-Computer File Systems

BSTS
-Every parent node has at most two children
-Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
-Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent
