What is Sorting?

- Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection(e.g. an array) so that the items 
are in some kind of order.

Why do we need to learn this?
-Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works
-There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages 
and disadvantages

Objectives 
-implement bubble sort
-Understand why it is important to learn these simpler sorting algorithms

BubbleSort
-A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!

BubbleSort Pseudocode
- Start looping with a variable called i the end of the array towards the beginning
- Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning until i -1
- If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two values!
- Return the sorted array
