What do they do?

- Data structures are collections of values, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that 
can be applied to the data
-Each data structure excells in a different situtation

Why so many?
- different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others like arrays
are more generally used.

Why Care?

- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
- You've already worked with many of them unknowingly -e.g. trees when interacting with the DOM
