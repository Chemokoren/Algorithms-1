Objectives

- Motivate the need for something like Big O Notation
- Describe what Big O Notation is
- Simplify Big O Expressions
- Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
- Evaluate the time complexity and space complexity of different algorithms using Big O Notation
- Describe what an algorithm is

What is the idea?

- Imagine we have multiple implementations of the same function.
- How can we determine which one is the "best"?

Example: 

"Write a function that accepts a string input and  returns a reversed copy"

There are like 10 implementations of this problem on stack overflow that work. How do you know which is the
best among them?
-Big O

Who Cares?

When dealing with huge datasets, efficient algorithms can save your hours

- It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how our code performs
- Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
- When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find 
pain points in our applications
- It comes up in interviews
