"""

Objectives
- Define what recursion is and how it can be used
- Understand the two essential components of a recursive function
- Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions
- Use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems

What is recursion
- A process(a function in our case) that calls itself

Why should you care?
- It's everywhere
    * DOM traversal algorithms
    * Object traversal
    * In more complex data structures
    * It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration
