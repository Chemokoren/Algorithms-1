Common Graph Algorithms
- DFS
Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph
Datastructures: Hashset (if recursive -to detect a cycle), stack if not recursive
-BFS
Time: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the graph
Datastructures: Queue -deque, hashset to detect duplicate nodes
-Union-Find
Time: O(nlog(n))
Datastructures: Forest of trees
Example: NUmber of connected components in Undirected Graph
-Topological Sort (Built on top of DFS)
Time: O(n)
DataStructures: Hashset
Example: Alien Dictionary
-Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algo
Time: E(log(V)) where V is the number of vertices/nodes & E number of edges
DataStructures: Heap & Hashset
Example: Network Delay Time
  
- Prim's or Kruska's (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- Floyd Warshall's Algorithms
