Word Ladder

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is
a sequence of words beginWord-> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

-Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
-Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
- sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of 
words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endword, or 0 if no such
sequence exists.

Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord ="cog", wordList =["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" ->"dot"->"dog"->"cog",
which is 5 words long.

Constrains:
len(w) <= 10
len(list) <=5000

transform n^2m to n.m^2 because m is smaller than n according to the constraints

BFS is much more efficient to find the shortest path than DFS

(use n.m^2 to generate adjacency list and n^2.m to traverse using BFS)
