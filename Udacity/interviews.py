Besides solving the algorithm, the inteviewer is also looking at problem solving skills, 
& communication skills

The steps are:
- Clarifying the Question
- Generating Inputs & Outputs
- Generating Test Cases
- Brainstorming
- Runtime Analysis
- Coding 
- Debugging

Clarifying the Question
-ensures that you are solving the right problem
-ensures that you don't waste time writing code that does not solve the initial issue

Confirming Inputs & Outputs
---------------------------
-Confirming the signature of the algorithm he will be writing
-Know he knows what is given in the problem and what the results needs to be
-what is the expected input e.g. matrix of an island
-what is the expected output e.g. count of islands(integer)
-Confirming the problem again to ensure that he is on the right track


Test cases
----------

-Start thinking through inputs and edge cases like none, empty matrix, matrix only has 0's & 1's
-Account for other values that could have been used in the matrix
-Always good to think about how your code will handle null and empty inputs since not addressing them 
could cause your code to crash

Brainstorming
-------------
- Test cases are handy when brainstorming
- Use interviewers cues to guide you to the correct solution
- Being able to take the interviewers feedback demonstrates your teamwork skills
- When stuck on one portion of the problem, you can start brainstorming with different datastructures

Runtime Analysis
----------------

-Analyse steps through your algorithm and calculate the Big O
-You may realize that your solution is not optimal while analyzing runtime

Coding
------

- After going through all the necessary steps before coding the solution the actual coding is alot easier
than just jumping and coding from the beginning.
- Let the interviewer know what you are doing when coding. But don't read out all your code while coding
because this can be very annoying-- does not built an understanding with the interviewer.
- Explain the purpose of the code
- By talking out loud, you give the interviewer the chance to jump in and help you if your logic is wrong
- You also proof to your interviewer that you are thinking through all of your code because if you just 
write code, you could be spitting out a memorized answer.

Debugging
---------
-do not overlook the debugging process coz it is a very important of algorithm inteview
-Tells the interviewer that the candidate checks their code and could also help you find mistakes you 
missed the first time when writing the solution.




Additional Material
-------------------

Websites:

    HackerRank: Website and community with programming challeges that you can go through for additional practice.
    Project Euler: This website has a ton of logic problems that you can practice writing coded solutions to.
    Interview Cake: Practice questions and some tutorials available.
    Interactive Python: Loads of tutorials on pretty much every topic covered here and many more, along with Python examples and concept questions.
    Topcoder: New practice problems every day, and some tech companies use answers to those problems to find new potential hires.
    LeetCode: Practice problems, mock interviews, and articles about problems.
    BigO Cheat Sheet: Summary of efficiencies for most common algorithms and data structures.(http://bigocheatsheet.com/)

Online Courses:

    Intro to Algorithms Course on Udacity: The course you just completed is essentially a prerequisite of the Intro to Algorithms course. Intro to Algorithms is largely about graph algorithmsâ€”you likely won't need most of them for interviews, but if you're interested in graph algorithms this is a great next step!
