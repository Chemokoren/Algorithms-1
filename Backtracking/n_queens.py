"""
Place N Queens on an NxN chessboard, in such a manner that no two queens attack each other. 
A queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.

   - Start in the leftmost column.
   - If all the queens are placed
        return true
   - Try all rows in the current column. Do the following for every tried row.
        - If the queen can be placed safely in this row, then mark this [row, column] as part of the
          solution and recursively check if placing the queen here leads to a solution.
        - If placing the queen in [row, column] leads to a solution, return true.
        - If placing the queen in [row, column] doesnâ€™t lead to a solution, then unmark this [row, column] 
        and go to the first step to try other rows.
   - If all rows have been tried and nothing worked, return false to trigger backtracking.
