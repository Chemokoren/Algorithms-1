 specific types of problems that lie under backtracking 

1) Decision Making ~ It means the problem where you have choices like whether to go left, down, up, or down. 
These types of problems mostly reside under backtracking.

2) Permutations ~ To find all possible permutations of any sequence data type we can use backtracking.

3) Subsets ~ Programming question where we are supposed to find all possible subset, subsequence-like things
 from any sequence data type then they are mostly solved using Backtracking.


How to Identify the Backtracking Problem

Some basic points that help in identifying the problem are backtracking.

    - Exponential Complexity or Factorial Complexity ~ You will be given that solution can be expected in 
                  exponential complexity because you have to explore each and every path.
    - Constraints ~ If complexity is more then obviously constraints will be less like N is less than 500.
    - No guarantee that which path to go first to find a solution because you are asked to find any solution 
    or all possible solutions.

1) Subset of a set
- Given a set of distinct integers, form a different subset of one single set.

# sample input 
set =[1,2,3]

# sample output
[[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3],[2],[2,3],[3]]


Explanation - One we can have an empty set as a subset of set and break all integers with every other
element which forms a subset. on reversing a subset it is also a subset because both are the same 
so keep only one.

2) Generate All Valid IP Addresses

One more interesting problem in backtracking. The problem statement is something like we are given a string 
containing only digits. our task is to generate all possible IPv4 Address combinations and print each 
combination in lexicographic order. 

üî∞NOTE - A valid IPv4 address contains exactly four integers. each integer is between 0 and 255 separated by 
single dots, and cannot have leading zeros except in the case of zero itself. 
read the example snippet below to get a better idea about what the IPv4 address should look like.

// The following are valid IP addresses:
0.1.24.255
18.5.244.1

// Following are invalid IP addresses:
0.01.24.255  (as  01  contains one leading zero).
18.312.244.1 (as 312 not lies between 0 and 255).

// Sample Input 1 :
2 
2122
23579

// Sample Output 1 :
[‚Äú2.1.2.2‚Äù]
[‚Äú2.3.5.79‚Äù, ‚Äú2.3.57.9‚Äù, ‚Äú2.35.7.9‚Äù, ‚Äú23.5.7.9‚Äù]

Approach to Solve the Problem üòÉ

Each four-part of IP address should be in the range of 0 to 255. To generate all possible approaches we need
to break a string into four different parts and check whether each part is a valid part or not. If it is valid 
then we will form its combination by placing the dots and saving the solution. So we can approach this problem
using iterative as well as recursive ways. So let us discuss each approach because the time complexity of
both is the same so both the solution will work absolutely fine.

A] Iterative Approach (Brute-Force method)

As we discuss that the idea is to divide the string into four parts and check if each part is valid and form 
its combination using 3 dots and add it to the resultant list. To check the valid part it must satisfy the 
below 2 conditions.

    - Each part must be between 0 and 255
    - No part should have leading zeros.

So we have to run a three-loop to complete the algorithm where we say that the first part is from 0 to I, 
the second part is I+1 to J, the third part is J+1 to K, and the fourth part is from K+1 to 
N(length of the string). So we can conclude the algorithm in the below steps.

    - Create a function to check whether each part is valid or not.
    - Create an empty list of results to store each combination
    - Now we will run 3 loops.
        - First will be I from 0 to n-3 which represents that it is the first part and after it, 
        3 parts are also there so the last 3 digits of string can never come in the first part.
        - The second loop (j) will be from i+1 to n-2 which represents that the second part is after the last 
        digit of the first part and after it, two more parts are present so the last 2 digits can never be 
        part of the second part.
        - The third loop (k) will be from j+1 to n-1 which represents that the third part is after the last 
        digit of the second part and after it, one more part is present which should have at least one 
        integer.
        - The last part will be after k+1 to n so no loop is required for it.

"""

B] Backtracking Approach

- The key idea of observation here is we can select either  1 or 2 or 3 digits at a time so in each step,
we will select 1,2,3 digits and move to next segment. Before moving we will also check that the current
segment  is valid of not. If it is not valid then there is no need to explore this path. 

backtracking steps:
- Create check functions that accept strings and check their validity for valid IP addresses
- We define an empty list to store all possible combinations.
- We implement a function e.g. backtracking which accepts 5 arguments as an original string(s), answer, 
current index(denoting current index), segments used to store segments, segment index which is used to 
store the current number of segments we are currently in.
- The initial current index and segment index will be 0.

Base Case
- If the current index is equal to N and the segment index is 4 then add the current path to answer and 
return.
- The recursion will also break when the current index equals N and the segment index is greater than 4

Constraints
- Add s[currentIndex+steps] to segment[segmentIndex]
- If the current index is valid then we will recur for the next segment and increase the current index
and segment index by 1
-Else if it is not valid then we will move to the next iteration


Complexity
- Time complexity is O(1)
- In the worst case, the total number of IP addresses is fixed so our function will remain constant 
after some particular value of the input. Hence the time complexity will be O(1)
-Space Complexity is O(1) - we used constant extra space

Rat in a maze
--------------

Has different names like: Shortest Path in a maze, Total steps in the path to reach a destination

We are given an N*N matrix of binary value blocks where the source cell is the upper left most block 
and the destination block is the lower rightmost block.
The rat can only move in two directions as forward and downward.

If the block number is 0 then it means it is a dead block(No entry) and the rat cannot visit there. 
If the block value is 1 then it is a valid block. 
Find if there is a way to reach the destination and find the path and print it.

Input and Output Format

-Given N as input denoting the number of rows and number of columns. And form an N rows with N 
space-seperated digits which form N*N Grid.
Return True if there exists a path to reach destination cell from source cell. Otherwise return False if no
such path exists.

// Sample Input - 1

N = 4

1  0  0  0 
1  1  0  0 
0  1  0  0 
0  1  1  1

// Sample Output - 1
True

Backtracking Approach
-Using recursion we will start from the initial position of the rat and check-in right and down direction
to see if it is a safe path to move forward. 
- If the path is valid then we move forward and again check both directions recursively. Whichever path gives 
us the solution after reaching the destination we return. 
- If we reach a dead-end before reaching the destination then we backtrack and start exploring another path.

Algorithm
- main functio accepts the maxe(matrixx) and the source position of the rat in a maze
- Create an empty matrix solution to store the path filled with 0's
- Create a recursive function that accepts the initial matrix, rat position coordinates, solution matrix,
and length of a matrix.
- Our base case is if we reach the destination then we have a valid path
- We check whether the current position is valid or not. If it is valid then check if it is already 
part of the solution matrix.
- Otherwise, add the path in the solution matrix and explore other paths in both the forward and 
downward directions using recursion.
- If any path is not valid then backtrack and explore other paths.

N-Queens Puzzle Problem
-----------------------

Name of the problem differes for example:
    - N-Queens problem to return any solution
    - N-Queens problem to return all possible solutions.
You are given an N*N matrix(square chessboard), and your task is to find all the possible ways that you 
can place N number of queens on that board such that no two queens can attack each other.

Chance of Two Queens attacking each-other
- If two queens are placed in the same Row
- If the two queens are placed in the same column
- If the two queens are placed in the same Diagonal.

Initially, we have a board of N*N which has all the values as 0. Now we have to find the feasible place of
Queens and change 0 to 1 and if you can place N queens in N*N return the solution

Input and Output Format
-The first line of input contains the number of a test case and each line of the test case contains an
 integer 'N' denoting the size of the chessboard. For each test case, print all the possible solutions If no
 solution is possitble then print an empty list.


// Sample Input 1:

// Sample Output 1:

1 0 0 0 
0 0 0 1 
0 1 0 0

0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1 
1 0 0 0 
0 0 1 0 

Explanation

The 4 queens can be placed in a 4*4 chessboard in two ways.


Backtracking approach
- So in each row, we have to check each position that is safe to place the Queen and if it is safe, then 
we can move to the next row and do the same till we do not reach the Nth row.
-And if in that row, position is not safe then we have to move to the next column in the same row till 
we find a safe place in the row.
- Now, if we are not able to find any safe place in that row, it means that in the above row, we have
placed the queen in the wrong position so we will backtrack from there and change the position of the
queen in the previous row.


How to check that position is safe or not?

- we already know that if one queen is already there in the same row, column, or diagonal then we cannot
place a queen. 
- So, we will have the position of row and column where we want to place a queen and we also know that the 
initial matrix contains all zeros  and that means if already a queen is there, it can only be present 
before our current position.
-So, we will check only in the above row and column position then the current position
- If a queen is already present in this direction then we cannot place a queen at the current position. 
Else it is valid.

Backtracking approach

- So the approach is we have to start from the top-left position array[0][0] to the bottom right 
array[8][8] and check for each position. If the position is already filled then we can simply move forward, 
Otherwise, it's our responsibility to find the digit between 1-9 which fits best at that position.


Algorithm:
-implement a function that accepts a Grid, row, and column value. Initially, we have to start with a 0-0
position, so the value of the row and column will be 0
- Check if the current position is already filled then we have to move to the next position which has two
cases.
    - we have to check that the current column is not last, which means we have to move to the next row
    because the matrix ends here
    - If we are not in the next column then in the same row we have to move forward meaning increasing the
    column by 1
- If the value at the current position is empty(denoted as 0) then we will run a loop from 1 to 9 and for
each value, we will check if this position is safe for the value then we will insert that value. And then 
we will move forward in the same way  as we have done in the above step.
-In any case, if we are not able to fill the next value in the next row, then we will backtrack to the 
previous value and make it zero, and check it for another value that is safe at that position.

In this way, if we successfully reach the last row and can fill it correctly then we have solved sudoku. 
The base case will be when row will be equal to 9 it means we have successfully reached a valid sudoku
solution. And for checking the value is valid or not we will build a separate function to check the value
should be unique in a row, column, and in a 3*3 sub-matrix.
