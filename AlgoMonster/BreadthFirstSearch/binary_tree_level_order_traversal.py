Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return its level order traversal. Input is the root node of the tree. The 
output should be a list of integers, with the ith list containing the values of nodes on level i
from left to right.

For example

                Level0 ........     1
                                   / \
                Level 1 ------    2   3
                                 / \   \
                Level 2 ------  4   5   6
                                 \
                Level 3 -----     7
