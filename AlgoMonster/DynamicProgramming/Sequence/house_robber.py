House Robber

You are a robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount 
of treasure stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing every one of them is 
that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact
the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the 
maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
