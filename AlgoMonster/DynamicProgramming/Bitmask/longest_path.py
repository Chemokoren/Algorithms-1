Longest Path | Dynamic Programming

Given a directed acyclic graph(DAG) compute the longest path that the graph contains. 
For the purposes of this question, a path is defined by the edges and the input graph is 
in the form of a list of lists where the list at index i in the array represents each of 
the connections formed by node i. The number of nodes is guaranteed to not exceed 100000.

Example:
Input:

1-->3--4
    ^
    |
    2
Output: 2
