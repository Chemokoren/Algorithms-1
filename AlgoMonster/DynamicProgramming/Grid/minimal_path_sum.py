Minimal Path Sum

Suppose we have a m x n matrix filled with non-negative integers, find a path from top
left corner to bottom right corner. which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its
path.

    Note: Movements can only be either down or right at any point in time.

Example:
Input:

  [

    [1,3,1],

    [1,5,1],

    [4,2,1]

  ]

Output:

7

Explanation:

Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
