Number of Ways to Partition a String into a Palindromes | Dynamic Programming

    Prereq: Palindrome Counting

The problem is exactly the same as in Palindrome Partitioning except instead of 
outputting every possible palindrome, we instead ask you to simply output the number of
possible partitions. The string size can be up to 2000 characters in length. 

The number will be guaranteed to fit into an int.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: aab
Output: 2
