Two Sum Sorted

Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, find two numbers that add up to a given 
target. Return the indices of the two numbers in ascending order. You can assume elements in the
array are unique and there is only one solution. Do this in O(n) time and with constant 
auxiliary space.

Input: [2 3 5 8 11 15], 5

Output: 0 1
