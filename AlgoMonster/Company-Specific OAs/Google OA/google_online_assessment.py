Google Online Assessment Questions 2021 | Google OA

The first step to getting a job at Google is to pass the online assessment, commonly referred as 
"OA". The OA is given to candidates immediately after your application is approved by the initial 
screening. If you pass the online assessment, you will move on to the next round which is commonly
phone interview screening. Although a recruiter may skip online assessment based on role/position
and years of experience. In 2021, certain Google offices are skipping online assessment together.

The most common format of an OA is two coding questions to complete them within one hours to 90 
minutes. The questions are typical data structure and algorithms questions you would see in 
LeetCode or HackerRank.
