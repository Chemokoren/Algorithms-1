Find the Number of Islands

Given a 2-dimensional matrix of values with 0 and 1, count the number of islands of 1. An island
consists of all value 1 cells and is surrounded by either an edge or all 0 cells. A cell can 
only be adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically, not diagonally.

1   1   1   0   0   0                   

1   1   1   1   0   0

1   1   1   0   0   0

0   1   0   0   0   0

0   0   0   0   1   0

0   0   0   0   0   0
