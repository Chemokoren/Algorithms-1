Skyline problem

A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in 
that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and heights
of all the buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output 
the skyline formed by these buildings collectively (Figure B).
