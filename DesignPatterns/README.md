Gamma Categorization
--------------------
Design Patterns are typically split into three categories
- This is called Gamma Categorization after Erich Gamma, one of GoF authors

Creational Patterns 
-------------------
- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
- Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
- Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

Structural Patterns
-------------------
- concerned with the structure (e.g. class members)
- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
- Stress the importance of good API design

Behavioural Patterns
--------------------

- They are all different; no central theme 
- They are all doing their own thing/ there is some overlap here and there e.g the strategy
and the template method design patterns. They are kind of doing the same thing but they are doing it using completely different object oriented mechanisms
- Each is unique in their approach meaning that they solve a particular problem in a particular way, have a particular set of concerns etc.
