# Python code to demonstrate working of
# nlargest() and nsmallest()

# importing "heapq" to implement heap queue
import heapq

# initializing list
li1 = [6, 7, 9, 4, 3, 5, 8, 10, 1]

# using heapify() to convert list into heap
heapq.heapify(li1)

# using nlargest to print 3 largest numbers
# prints 10, 9 and 8
print("The 3 largest numbers in list are : ",end="")

# using nsmallest to print 3 smallest numbers
# prints 1, 3 and 4
