# Find Eulerian Tour
#
# Write a function that takes in a graph
# represented as a list of tuples
# and return a list of nodes that
# you would follow on an Eulerian Tour
#
# For example, if the input graph was
# [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1)]
# A possible Eulerian tour would be [1, 2, 3, 1]

def find_eulerian_tour(graph):
    # your code here
    return []
