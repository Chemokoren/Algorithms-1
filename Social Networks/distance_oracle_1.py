#
# In the shortest-path oracle described in Andrew Goldberg's
# interview, each node has a label, which is a list of some other
# nodes in the network and their distance to these nodes.  These lists
# have the property that
#
#  (1) for any pair of nodes (x,y) in the network, their lists will
#  have at least one node z in common
#
#  (2) the shortest path from x to y will go through z.
#
# Given a graph G that is a balanced binary tree, preprocess the graph to
# create such labels for each node.  Note that the size of the list in
# each label should not be larger than log n for a graph of size n.
#

#
# create_labels takes in a balanced binary tree and the root element
# and returns a dictionary, mapping each node to its label
#
# a label is a dictionary mapping another node and the distance to
# that node
#
def create_labels(binarytreeG, root):
	# BFS for the binary tree, meanwhile labeling each node in each level
	labels = {root: {root: 0}}
	frontier = [root]
	while frontier:
		cparent = frontier.pop(0)
		for child in binarytreeG[cparent]:
			if child in labels:
				continue
			labels[child] = {child: 0}
			weight = binarytreeG[cparent][child]
			labels[child][cparent] = weight
			# make use of the labels already computed
			for ancestor in labels[cparent]:
				labels[child][ancestor] = weight + labels[cparent][ancestor]
