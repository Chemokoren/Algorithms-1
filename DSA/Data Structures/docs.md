# Algorithm Analysis
### Concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms are central to computing
### We need an analysis tool to measure "goodness" of the Data Structure Operations and Algorithms

# Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: Amount of Time it takes to run an Algorithm
- Space Complexity: Amount of Memory used by the algorithm

### Time Complexity
- There may be several ways of computing a tasks, for example searching or sorting
- Running time of algorithm or data structure operation increases with input size
- The algorithms are characterized according to the function of the input size
### Time Complexity - Experimental Analysis
- Running time of an algorithm can be measured by executing it on various inputs
- There by recording the time spent on each execution
- Python and several other programming languages provide time function
- Elapse time can be computed by recording the start and end of algorithm
### Disadvantages of Experimental Analysis
-  Experiments should be performed in the same hardware and software environments
-  Experiments can be done only on limited inputs
### Time Complexity - Theoretical Analysis
- Analysis is performed directly on description of the algorithm or actual program or function/operation
- Independent of hardware and software environments
- Takes all possible inputs

### Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles for oop
- When abstraction paradigm is applied to the design of Data Structures, ADT's are formed
- ADT is mathematical model for Data Structures
- ADT's specifies:
  - Types of data stored
  - Operations supported
  - Parameters for the operations
- ADT specify what each operation does
- ADT does not specify how operations are done
