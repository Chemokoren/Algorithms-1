# Deque data structure
- works the same way as queues with additional functionality i.e. you can add as well as remove from front & rear
# Deques abstract data type
- Deque ADT stores objects
- Insert & Delete operations at both ends (Front & Rear)
- Operations:
  - add_first(object) : insert at front of the deque
  - add_last(object): insert at end of the deque
  - deletes_first(): remove from front of the deque
  - deletes_last(): remove from rear of the deque
  - first(): returns element at the front
  - last(): returns element at the rear
  - len(): returns number of elements
  - isEmpty(): whether deque is empty or not
