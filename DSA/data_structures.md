# What is Data?
- Data is some useful information stored in some computer memory (documents, photos & images, videos, software programs and applications)
- 

# Why do we need data structures?
# Why is it important?
# Why do we need to study internal structure of data?
# Why is it important to implement data structures?

- Data can be stored in the memory in several ways 
- Using data structures, we can store data efficiently
- Data Structures is a way of arranging the data efficiently in the memory
- Applications or programs that use this data can access it efficiently
- Applications or programs contains algorithms
- Algorithms are set of instructions or rules that perform some task or operations in finite amount of time
- Data structures is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data

# Categories of Data Structures
## - Linear Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Deques, Linked Lists)
## - Non-Linear Data Structures (Trees, Heaps, Graphs)
